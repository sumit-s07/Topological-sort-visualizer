# Topological-sort-visualizer
Topological sort and graph visualizer
This project consists of a topological sorting program and a graphical visualization tool for visualizing the graph and topological sort order. Project Structure: The project includes the following folders: • TopologicalSort: Contains the C++ code for performing topological sort on a directed graph. • ProjectVisualizer: A web-based visualization tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize the graph structure and topological sorting. TopologicalSort: • code.cpp: C++ program that performs a topological sort on a predefined graph. ProjectVisualizer: • index.html: HTML structure for the visualization tool. • style.css: CSS styles for a dark theme and layout adjustments. • script.js: JavaScript code for handling graph rendering and user interaction. Dependencies TopologicalSort/ • C++ Compiler (e.g., g++) ProjectVisualizer/ • Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) Installation TopologicalSort

1. Navigate to the TopologicalSort/ folder.
2. Compile the code.cpp file using a C++ compiler using following command on integrated terminal: “g++ Main.cpp -o TopologicalSort” ProjectVisualizer No additional setup is required for the web-based visualizer. Just open the index.html file in a web browser to start the visualization tool.
Running the Code

Running the C++ Topological Sort Program
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the TopologicalSort/ folder.
2. Run the compiled executable: Bash command: ./TopologicalSort
3. The program will output the topological order of the predefined graph or an error if a cycle is detected.
4. Running the Web-Based Graph Visualizer
5. Navigate to the ProjectVisualizer/ folder.
6. Open index.html in a web browser: Bash command: open index.html
7. Use the control panel to select a predefined graph or input custom graph data. Enjoy exploring and visualizing the topological sorting of graphs!
